# Render Static Site Redirects Configuration
# This fixes SPA routing issues where /auth/callback returns 404

# Redirect all non-asset requests to index.html for React Router to handle
# This is critical for OAuth callbacks and direct navigation to app routes

# API requests should not be redirected (if any)
/api/*  https://swayami-backend.onrender.com/api/:splat  200

# Static assets should be served as-is (no redirect needed - Render handles this)
# Images, JS, CSS, fonts, etc. are served directly

# All other routes should serve index.html for React Router SPA routing
